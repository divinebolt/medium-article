      <h2>Rainforest</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Rainforests</strong> are characterized by a closed and continuous
        tree canopy, moisture-dependent vegetation, the presence of epiphytes
        and lianas and the absence of wildfire. Rainforest can be classified as
        tropical rainforest or temperate rainforest, but other types have been
        described. Estimates vary from 40% to 75% of all biotic species being
        indigenous to the rainforests. There may be many millions of species of
        plants, insects and microorganisms still undiscovered in tropical
        rainforests. Tropical rainforests have been called the "jewels of the
        Earth" and the "world's largest pharmacy", because over one quarter of
        natural medicines have been discovered there. Rainforests as well as
        endemic rainforest species are rapidly disappearing due to
        deforestation, the resulting habitat loss and pollution of the
        atmosphere.

      <h2>Amazon rainforest</h2>
      <p>
        The Amazon rainforest, alternatively, the Amazon jungle or Amazonia, is
        a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in the Amazon biome that covers
        most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin encompasses
        7,000,000 km2 (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 5,500,000 km2 (2,100,000 sq
        mi) are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory
        belonging to nine nations and 3,344 formally acknowledged indigenous
        territories.<br />

        The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60% of the
        rainforest, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor
        amounts in Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and
        Venezuela. Four nations have "Amazonas" as the name of one of their
        first-level administrative regions, and France uses the name "Guiana
        Amazonian Park" for its rainforest protected area. The Amazon represents
        over half of the planet's remaining rainforests, and comprises the
        largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world,
        with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000
        species.<br />

        More than 30 million people of 350 different ethnic groups live in the
        Amazon, which are subdivided into 9 different national political systems
        and 3,344 formally acknowledged indigenous territories. Indigenous
        peoples make up 9% of the total population with 60 of the groups
        remaining largely isolated.

      <h2>Congolian rainforests</h2>
      <p>
        The Congolian rainforests are a broad belt of lowland tropical moist
        broadleaf forests which extend across the basin of the Congo River and
        its tributaries in Central Africa.
